Yuanzhibang development can be divided into three parts in total. The first part is web development, which implement different functions through the `js` interface. The second part is server development. It interacts with the OAuth server through the api, obtains data such as user-related data, and obtains authorized `token`. The third part is extension development, please refer to the [Extension Development](/#/en/extension-develop/default ':ignore') chapter for details.
