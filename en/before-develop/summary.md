Yuanzhibang development can be divided into three parts in total. The first part is web development, which is used to achieve different interactive functions with the client through the `js` interface. The second part is server development. It interacts with the Apezhibang server through the interface, obtains business interfaces such as user-related data, and obtains various authorized `token` operations. The third part is expansion development, please refer to the expansion development chapter for details.
